# QRL improvement proposals (QIPs)

The QRL Improvement Proposals (QIPs) repository handles proposals to improve the QRL core protocol and other layers that effects most or all QRL technical implementations. 

It covers the following layers

- **core**: Improvements requiring a consensus fork.
  - **networking**: Improvements around network components
  - **security**: Improvements and upgrades to to the security.
- **meta**: QIP process, governance, and structure.

For proposals that don't effect most or all of QRL technical implementations, such as client implementations (eg. wallets, explorers), as well as non-technical related proposals (design, advocacy), but where consensus is required, there is a QRL Enhancement Program (QEP) being developed over at The QRL Contributors modeled after QIPs.

# Governance & Structure

Anyone can and is encouraged to submit a QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) if they have an idea to improve the QRL core protocol.

Once an idea is put by the community, the QRL Improvement Proposal (QIP) starts and remains as a draft until it's to the point where the authors are happy with it (such as where it will likely gain widest acceptance) and which is sufficiently specified to the satisfaction of the QIP custodians Jack Matier (@jackalyst), James Gordon (@fr1t2), and JP Lomas (@jplomas).  

At this point the QIP enters a proposal, and parameters are set for on-chain governance. More can be read in our '[qip-workflow](qip-workflow.md)' document.

# How to submit

Please see the [qip-workflow](qip-workflow.md) for a detailed submission process guide.

Other important documents include:

- [qips/reference](qips/reference.md): Reference QIP to duplicate and build off of.
- [qip-template](qip-template.md): Includes a kitchen sink of everything that can be included in a QIP.
- [qip-specification](qip-specification.md): Expands on the specification of each section.

# Special thanks

QRL Improvement Proposals (QIP) have been heavily influenced by [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/) and [Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips), with some modification in areas to fit the needs of the QRL project.

A special thanks goes out to Ethereum and Bitcoin for being so seminal to blockchain and decentralized governance.
